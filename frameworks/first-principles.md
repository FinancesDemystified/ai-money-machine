Use first principles 

First principles can be applied step by step to any problem by breaking it down to its most basic truths and rebuilding from there. Here is a practical, end-to-end approach you can follow.

What first principles thinking is (quick recap)
- It’s a problem-solving method that starts from fundamental, self-evident truths rather than relying on existing solutions or analogies.
- The goal is to reveal new possibilities by reconstructing the solution from the ground up.

Comprehensive, step-by-step process
1) Define the problem clearly
- State the problem in precise terms.
- Identify the goal, constraints, and success criteria.
- Capture what would count as a successful outcome.

2) Gather all relevant facts
- List all known, verifiable truths related to the problem.
- Distinguish between facts, assumptions, and opinions.
- Collect data, constraints, costs, timeframes, and any domain-specific requirements.

3) Break the problem into fundamental components
- Decompose the system into its most basic building blocks.
- For each component, ask: What is the simplest, indivisible element here?
- Remove dependencies on existing solutions; focus on elemental pieces rather than current implementations.

4) Challenge every assumption
- For each component or step, identify underlying assumptions.
- Ask why each assumption is true and whether it can be replaced or eliminated.
- Seek alternative explanations or methods that don’t rely on the assumed norms.

5) Identify the true first principles
- Determine the core, non-derivable truths that govern the problem.
- These are the axioms or fundamental constraints that cannot be reduced further within the context.

6) Reconstruct from the ground up
- Build multiple potential solutions starting from the first principles.
- Consider different configurations, processes, or designs that respect the core truths.
- Evaluate each alternative against the success criteria and constraints.

7) Test with simple experiments or calculations
- Run small, low-risk tests or quick calculations to validate core ideas.
- Use these results to prune infeasible approaches and refine viable ones.

8) Choose, implement, and iterate
- Select the most promising solution based on evidence from the tests.
- Plan implementation with milestones, metrics, and risk assessments.
- Iterate: If new data contradicts the foundation, revisit the fundamental truths and adjust.

Practical tips and patterns
- Use analogies sparingly: they can obscure true foundations; rely on direct analysis of basic elements when possible.
- Document the first principles and the reconstruction paths so others can verify and replicate.
- When scaling, verify that each added component remains aligned with the foundational truths; it’s easy to drift from principles under complexity.

Examples tailored to your interests
- Building a Bible study app with licensing: start from core rights (text licensing, usage rights, distribution terms) and user data needs, then reconstruct features from those foundations rather than copying a competitor’s workflow.
- Real-time trading signal service: begin with fundamental data integrity, latency bounds, and consented data sources, then design architecture and features from those baselines rather than from existing platforms.
- Automating AI agent workflows: identify the essential signals (input formats, reliability, explainability), then assemble the orchestration around those non-negotiables rather than around a preferred toolchain.
