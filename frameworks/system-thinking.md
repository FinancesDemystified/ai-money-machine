## Systems Thinking Framework (Full Process)

### 1) Define the system and its boundaries  
- Identify what system you are studying and where its boundaries lie.  
- Determine what is **inside** (actors, processes, resources) and **outside** the system.  
- List the stakeholders and consider their perspectives, interests, and influences.  
- Create a **system map** (nodes and connections) to visualize interactions and dependencies.[2][3]

### 2) Tell the story (understand the current system)  
- Gather stakeholder narratives and describe how the system currently functions.  
- Use tools like **concept maps** to represent the flow of processes, feedback loops, and exchanges.  
- Identify key elements and how they interact over time.[1]

### 3) Draw behavior-over-time (BOT) graphs  
- Express how critical variables behave across time (e.g., demand, costs, delays).  
- Plot trends to see where feedback loops, delays, or tipping points may exist.  
- Look for recurring patterns (growth, oscillation, collapse, stagnation).[1]

### 4) Create a focusing statement  
- Translate the problem story into a clear **focusing statement** that defines:  
  - The intended outcome (“What do we want to happen?”)  
  - The observed problem (“What seems to be happening?”)  
  - The suspected cause (“Why might it be happening?”)  
- This step ensures alignment before deeper analysis.[1]

### 5) Identify the structure of the system  
- Map **causal relationships** between events and variables.  
- Use **causal loop diagrams** to show reinforcing (positive feedback) and balancing (negative feedback) cycles.  
- Identify **system archetypes** (e.g., “limits to growth,” “shifting the burden”) that explain recurring problems.[2][1]

### 6) Go deeper into mental models and purposes  
- Explore the beliefs and assumptions that drive stakeholder actions.  
- Clarify the **purpose** of the system — what outcomes it is *actually* optimized for, not what it claims to achieve.  
- Examine how mental models sustain patterns of behavior.[3][1]

### 7) Identify patterns of behavior  
- From behavior-over-time graphs and causal loops, identify repeating cycles and leverage points.  
- Analyze how these patterns evolve and reinforce each other.  
- Seek points where small changes could produce big shifts (“high leverage points”).[3][2]

### 8) Plan and prototype interventions  
- Design potential interventions to modify system structures, feedback, or flows.  
- Consider how each intervention might affect the system as a whole (including unintended feedback).  
- Use simulations or scenario mapping to test system responses before implementing changes.[3][1]

### 9) Implement and monitor  
- Introduce selected interventions gradually.  
- Track system reactions over time using the same BOT graphs and causal maps.  
- Adjust boundaries and assumptions as new data emerges.  
- Maintain an iterative loop: observe → map → intervene → learn → update.[3]

## Why choose systems thinking over design thinking

Design thinking optimizes for *human desirability* and solution creativity, but it can miss long-term, structural interactions and side effects. Systems thinking, in contrast:  
- Reveals hidden feedback loops and leverage points.  
- Handles complex, multi-stakeholder environments (e.g., AI ecosystems or platform governance).  
- Balances human, technical, and environmental dimensions simultaneously rather than focusing purely on user-level experiences.  

It’s ideal for solving issues like AI bias propagation, multi-agent orchestration, housing regulation ecosystems, or nonprofit automation networks — essentially any problem that spans multiple layers of cause and effect.[2][1][3]
