- Behavior chains with progression
- 3-5 Zapier automation workflows
- Comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Implementation plan with testing framework

### üöÄ Demo Script

**Opening:** "I'll demonstrate the 4D Product Framework by developing [YOUR PRODUCT CONCEPT]. This will take about 51-76 minutes and show you how to go from concept to comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) using AI tools."

**Phase Transitions:**
- "D1 Discovery complete - we've validated the problem and identified first principles"
- "D2 Dynamics complete - we understand the system dynamics and leverage points"
- "D3 Difficulty complete - we have user-centered solutions and implementation plan"
- "D4 Drive complete - we have behavior design, automation, and comprehensive PRD ready"

**Closing:** "The 4D Product Framework has taken us from concept to comprehensive Product Requirements Document. We have validated the problem, understood the system dynamics, created user-centered solutions, designed behavior systems with automation, and generated a complete PRD following the Golden Circle structure. This is ready for development teams."

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Key Success Factors

**Speed Optimization:**
- Stick to time limits per phase
- Focus on high-impact activities
- Capture insights quickly
- Move between phases efficiently

**Quality Assurance:**
- Evidence-based decisions at each phase
- Clear deliverables in JSON format
- Actionable next steps
- Ready for implementation

**Demo Impact:**
- Complete product development cycle in under 60 minutes
- Systematic AI-assisted approach
- Real-world applicable results
- Demonstrates the power of structured thinking

### üéØ Next Steps

1. **Choose your demo product** (or use one of the examples provided)
2. **Execute prompts in sequence** (D1 ‚Üí D2 ‚Üí D3 ‚Üí D4)
3. **Follow time limits** (10-15 minutes per phase)
4. **Capture all outputs** (save JSON results)
5. **Synthesize final results** (create implementation roadmap)

**Ready to Launch:** After completing all four phases, you'll have a complete product development cycle ready for implementation with clear next steps, validated assumptions, and automated workflows.
