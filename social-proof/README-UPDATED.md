### Step 2: Choose Your Approach

**Option A: Course-Focused (RECOMMENDED)**
- Use `linkedin-revised-course-focused.md`
- Best for: Authority building + direct enrollment
- Price point: $1,497-$1,997 requires expert positioning
- Timeline: November 1st launch requires direct CTAs

**Option B: Build in Public**
- Use `linkedin-build-in-public-version.md`
- Best for: Community building + softer selling
- Good if: You prefer authentic/vulnerable approach

### Step 3: Record Your 6-Minute Video

**Structure:**
1. Hook (0:00-0:30): "I'm validating in public"
2. Problem (0:30-2:00): Finance app case study
3. Methodology (2:00-3:30): Frameworks and strategy
4. Strategy (3:30-5:00): $100/2-hour validation plan
5. Lesson (5:00-5:45): Repeatable system for any AI product
6. CTA (5:45-6:00): Join AI Money Machine

**Video Tips:**
- Add captions (most watch without sound)

- Show the actual frameworks and prompts
- End with strong CTA

## üéì The Strategic Shift

### What Changed?

- No clear monetization

**After:** Teaching + Lead Gen post
