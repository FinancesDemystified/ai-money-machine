# LinkedIn Post - Build in Public Version (Alternative)

## Post Content for Video (6 minutes)

**I'm about to validate an AI product idea in public. In real-time. With a $100 budget and 2 hours.**

Why? Because I just spent 60 minutes teaching my students the #1 rule of building AI products: **Validate BEFORE you build.**

And I realized... I should practice what I preach. Right here. Right now. With all of you watching.

**The Experiment:**

I identified a problem that affects millions: Recently laid-off individuals panic about accessing 401K funds. They get generic financial advice when they need specialized crisis guidance.

My hypothesis: There's demand for AI-powered financial guidance specifically designed for unemployment scenarios.

**The Validation Strategy (under $100, 2 hours):**
- Platform-specific social posts (LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram)
- Focus on engagement over vanity metrics
- Provocative questions + personal stories
- Measure interest BEFORE writing code

**In this 6-minute video, you'll see:**
- The strategic frameworks I'm using (Golden Circle, First Principles)
- The exact social prompts I created
- How to protect your idea while testing demand
- The success metrics I'm tracking
- Why I'm doing this as a teaching moment

**Here's where it gets interesting:**

This isn't just about ONE product idea. This is about the METHODOLOGY. The system. The repeatable process.

And this is exactly what we teach in **AI Money Machine** â€” my 4-week program where non-technical founders build and launch their first AI product. From idea to income. With live guidance every step.

We kick off November 1st. And I'm bringing my students through this exact validation process before they build anything.

**I'm curious:**

1. Have you ever spent months building something only to realize nobody wanted it? What would you have done differently?

2. What AI product idea are you sitting on right now that needs validation?

3. What's stopping you from testing demand before you build?

Drop your answers below. Let's learn together.

## Comparison: Which Version Should You Use?

### Use Course-Focused Version If:
- âœ… Primary goal is course enrollment
- âœ… You want to establish expert authority
- âœ… Your audience responds to structured teaching
- âœ… You're comfortable with direct selling
- âœ… You want to maximize conversion rate

### Use Build in Public Version If:
- âœ… Primary goal is community building
- âœ… You want to emphasize authenticity
- âœ… Your audience values transparency
- âœ… You prefer softer selling approach
- âœ… You want to maximize engagement first

### My Recommendation:
**Use the Course-Focused Version** because:

1. Your course price ($1,497-$1,997) requires strong authority positioning
2. Your target audience (people who want to build AI products) respond to expertise
3. Your course value proposition is "hands-on guidance" which requires trust in your expertise
4. You have limited time before November 1st launch (need direct CTAs)
5. Your sales page already uses authority positioning (VP at JPMorgan, Northwestern MS, patent holder)
