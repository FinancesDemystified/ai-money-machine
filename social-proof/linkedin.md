**The brutal truth about layoffs that nobody talks about:**

Last month, I watched my friend Sarah panic as she stared at her $50K 401K balance. Laid off after 8 years in tech, she was terrified of the 10% penalty but had no emergency fund.

Here's what shocked me: Every financial advisor told her the same generic advice. "Don't touch your 401K." "Build an emergency fund." "Diversify your portfolio."

But Sarah wasn't asking about retirement planning. She was asking about survival.

The financial industry has a massive blind spot. We have apps for everything - budgeting, investing, crypto, even pet insurance. But when life hits hardest, when someone loses their job and needs to navigate 401K withdrawals strategically while continuing to build wealth... crickets.

Generic advice doesn't work in crisis mode. A 25-year-old with $15K in their 401K needs different guidance than a 55-year-old with $200K.

I'm exploring something that could change this. What if we had AI-powered financial guidance specifically designed for unemployment scenarios? Not generic advice, but personalized strategies that help people preserve wealth while meeting immediate needs.

**Here's what I'm curious about:**

What's the worst financial advice you received during a layoff? What worked? What didn't?

And here's the provocative question: Why do we treat unemployment like a financial taboo instead of a normal life event that deserves specialized guidance?
