## Caption Strategy

**Main Caption:**
The financial advice industry has a massive blind spot: they treat unemployment like a rare disease instead of a normal life event.

When someone gets laid off and needs to access their 401K strategically, they get generic advice that doesn't work in crisis mode.

My friend Sarah got laid off last month. $50K in her 401K, zero emergency fund, panicking about penalties. Every advisor told her the same thing: "Don't touch it."

But she wasn't asking about retirement planning. She was asking about survival.

Here's the brutal truth: A 25-year-old with $15K in their 401K needs completely different guidance than a 55-year-old with $200K. But the industry gives them the same generic advice.

We have apps for everything - budgeting, investing, crypto, even pet insurance. But when life hits hardest? When someone needs specialized 401K withdrawal strategies? Crickets.

I'm exploring something that could change this. AI-powered financial guidance specifically designed for unemployment scenarios. Not generic advice. Personalized strategies.

What's the worst financial advice you received during a layoff? What actually worked when you needed to access retirement funds?

Drop your stories below. The responses that make me think the most will get early access to what I'm building.
