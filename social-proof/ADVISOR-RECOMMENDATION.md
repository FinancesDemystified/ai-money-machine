# Strategic Advisor Recommendation

## Executive Summary

You're right to pivot the LinkedIn post. The original version positioned you as a product builder, but your real goal is to drive enrollment to the AI Money Machine course ($1,497-$1,997) while demonstrating the validation methodology to students.

## Key Questions Answered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Does it act as lead gen for the 4-week intensive?

**Original Post:** ‚ùå No course mention, no CTA, no clear conversion path

**Revised Post:** ‚úÖ Yes
- Opens with teaching authority
- Positions course as the "full methodology"
- Clear CTA to course in first comment
- Creates FOMO (starts November 1st)
- Multiple touchpoints to enrollment

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Does it show you're validating in public to benefit students?

**Original Post:** ‚ùå Focused on ONE product validation, not the process

**Revised Post:** ‚úÖ Yes
- Explicitly states "as a teaching moment for my students"
- Uses finance app as CASE STUDY, not main product
- Shows you practice what you preach
- Invites students to learn the methodology
- Demonstrates transparency and authenticity

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Will LinkedIn accept a 6-minute video?

‚úÖ **YES** - LinkedIn supports videos up to **10 minutes**, so 6 minutes is perfect.

**Pro tip:** Keep the video high-quality with:
- Strong hook in first 5 seconds
- Captions/subtitles (most watch without sound)
- Clear visual structure (screen recordings, talking head, graphics)
- Strong CTA at the end

## My Strategic Recommendation

### Use the **Course-Focused Version** (linkedin-revised-course-focused.md)

**Why:**

1. **Authority Positioning**: Your $1,497-$1,997 price point requires strong expertise positioning
2. **Target Audience**: People paying $2K for a course want to learn from an expert, not just a fellow builder
3. **Sales Page Alignment**: Your course page emphasizes your credentials (VP at JPMorgan, Northwestern MS, patent holder)
4. **Time Constraint**: November 1st launch requires direct CTAs, not soft selling
5. **Clear Value Ladder**: Teaching ‚Üí Methodology ‚Üí Course enrollment

### Opening Lines

**Use this version:**
```
I just taught a 60-minute crash course on building AI products that actually sell.

The #1 lesson? Validate the idea BEFORE you build the thing.

Most people fail because they spend months building something nobody wants. I teach my students to spend less than $100 and 2 hours to validate demand first. Fail fast, pivot faster.

So I'm practicing what I preach. Right now. In public. As a teaching moment for my students.
```

**Why this works:**
- Establishes teaching authority immediately
- Positions you as an expert who has systems/processes
- Creates curiosity about the methodology
- Frames the finance app as a teaching example
- Makes the course the natural next step

| Goal | Original Post | Revised Post | Status |

## What to AVOID

### ‚ùå Don't:
1. Focus too much on the finance app (it's just an example)
2. Reveal all the features (protect competitive advantage)
3. Make it about you (make it about the methodology)
4. Oversell the course (let the value speak)
5. Forget to engage with comments (algorithm killer)

### ‚úÖ Do:
1. Position yourself as a teacher/mentor
2. Use the finance app as a teaching vehicle
3. Show vulnerability and transparency
4. Create multiple engagement touchpoints
5. Respond to every comment within first hour

## The Bigger Picture

This post isn't just about validating one product or enrolling a few students. It's about:

1. **Building Your Brand** as someone who practices what they preach
2. **Creating Social Proof** for future marketing
3. **Testing Your Message** before scaling ads
4. **Building Community** around your methodology
5. **Documenting The Journey** for case studies

## Final Thoughts

The original post was good for product validation. But you're not just validating a product ‚Äî you're validating your teaching methodology, building your authority, and enrolling students.

The revised post accomplishes all three goals while maintaining authenticity and demonstrating real value.

**My recommendation:** Use the **Course-Focused Version** and focus on engagement over vanity metrics. The comments and conversations you generate will be more valuable than the likes.

And remember: Every comment is a potential student. Every question is a teaching moment. Every DM is an enrollment opportunity.

Build in public. Teach in public. Enroll in public.

That's how you turn a LinkedIn post into a revenue machine.
