# Social Proof Validation Strategy

## Overview
This directory contains platform-specific prompts designed to validate the AI personal finance app idea for recently laid-off individuals. The goal is to generate engagement (likes/comments) while building in public as a proof point for students, spending less than $100 and 2 hours total.

## Strategic Framework Application

### Golden Circle Integration

- **HOW**: AI-powered guidance specifically designed for unemployment scenarios, combining 401K strategy optimization with micro-investing and community support
- **WHAT**: Specific app features (hinted at but not revealed to protect competitive advantage)

### Design Thinking Approach
- **Empathize**: Focus on the emotional journey of laid-off individuals
- **Define**: The problem is lack of specialized financial guidance during unemployment
- **Ideate**: Hint at innovative solutions without revealing specifics

### First Principles Application

- **Challenge Assumption**: That generic financial advice works for unemployment scenarios
- **Rebuild**: Suggest specialized, AI-powered, community-driven approach
