# Quick Reference Card - LinkedIn Video Post

## 🎯 Your Opening Lines (Use This)

```
I just taught a 60-minute crash course on building AI products that actually sell.

The #1 lesson? Validate the idea BEFORE you build the thing.

Most people fail because they spend months building something nobody wants. 
I teach my students to spend less than $100 and 2 hours to validate demand first. 
Fail fast, pivot faster.

So I'm practicing what I preach. Right now. In public. 
As a teaching moment for my students.
