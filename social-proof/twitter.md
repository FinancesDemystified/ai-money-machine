# Twitter Validation Prompt

## Thread Content (Multiple tweets for maximum engagement)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
The financial advice industry has a massive blind spot: they treat unemployment like a rare disease instead of a normal life event.

When someone gets laid off and needs to access their 401K strategically, they get generic advice that doesn't work in crisis mode.

ðŸ§µ

**Tweet 2 (Problem Statement):**
"Don't touch your 401K" 
"Build an emergency fund"
"Diversify your portfolio"

This advice is useless when you're choosing between 401K penalties and losing your apartment.

**Tweet 3 (Provocative Statement):**
Here's the brutal truth: A 25-year-old with $15K in their 401K needs completely different guidance than a 55-year-old with $200K.

But the industry gives them the same generic advice.

**Tweet 4 (Personal Story):**
My friend Sarah got laid off last month. $50K in her 401K, zero emergency fund, panicking about penalties.

Every advisor told her the same thing: "Don't touch it."

But she wasn't asking about retirement planning. She was asking about survival.

**Tweet 5 (Industry Criticism):**
We have apps for everything - budgeting, investing, crypto, even pet insurance.

But when life hits hardest? When someone needs specialized 401K withdrawal strategies? Crickets.

**Tweet 6 (Solution Hint):**
I'm exploring something that could change this. AI-powered financial guidance specifically designed for unemployment scenarios.

Not generic advice. Personalized strategies.

**Tweet 7 (Engagement Question):**
What's the worst financial advice you received during a layoff?

What actually worked when you needed to access retirement funds?

**Tweet 8 (Call to Action):**
Drop your stories below. The responses that make me think the most will get early access to what I'm building.
