**Title:** "The financial advice industry completely ignores laid-off workers - change my mind"

**Post:**

I need to get something off my chest, and I'm curious if others feel the same way.

Last week, I was helping a friend navigate a layoff situation. She's 35, has $50K in her 401K, zero emergency fund, and was panicking about needing to access some money to survive.

Every single financial resource I found gave the same generic advice:
- "Don't touch your 401K"
- "Build an emergency fund" 
- "Diversify your investments"

But here's the thing - she's not asking about retirement planning. She's asking about SURVIVAL.

The personal finance community treats unemployment like it's some rare, exotic condition that only happens to irresponsible people. But layoffs are happening everywhere right now. Tech, manufacturing, retail - it's not about being irresponsible, it's about life happening.

**Here's what I'm frustrated with:**

1. **Generic advice doesn't work in crisis mode** - A 25-year-old with $15K in their 401K needs completely different guidance than a 55-year-old with $200K

2. **The "emergency fund" advice is tone-deaf** - If someone had an emergency fund, they wouldn't be asking about 401K withdrawals

3. **Nobody talks about strategic 401K withdrawals** - There are ways to minimize penalties and taxes, but good luck finding that info when you're panicking

4. **The focus is always on "don't touch retirement"** - But what if touching it strategically is better than going into debt or losing your house?

I'm exploring building something that could actually help people in this situation. Not generic advice, but personalized strategies based on age, 401K balance, debt situation, and timeline.

**Questions for the community:**

- What's the worst financial advice you got during unemployment?
- What actually worked when you needed to access retirement funds?
- Am I crazy for thinking the industry ignores this massive need?
- What would you want to see in a tool designed specifically for laid-off workers?

I'm genuinely curious about your experiences. The comments that make me think the most will get early access to what I'm building.
