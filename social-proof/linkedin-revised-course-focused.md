## Post Content for Video (6 minutes)

**I just taught a 60-minute crash course on building AI products that actually sell.**

The #1 lesson? **Validate the idea BEFORE you build the thing.**

Most people fail because they spend months building something nobody wants. I teach my students to spend less than $100 and 2 hours to validate demand first. Fail fast, pivot faster.

So I'm practicing what I preach. Right now. In public. As a teaching moment for my students.

**Here's the experiment:**

I identified a problem: Recently laid-off individuals need specialized financial guidance to access 401K funds strategically while continuing to build wealth. The financial industry treats unemployment like a rare disease instead of a normal life event.

Generic advice doesn't work in crisis mode. A 25-year-old with $15K in their 401K needs completely different guidance than a 55-year-old with $200K.

**My hypothesis:** There's demand for AI-powered financial guidance specifically designed for unemployment scenarios.

**The validation strategy (under $100, 2 hours):**
- Platform-specific social posts on LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram
- Focus on engagement (comments > likes)
- Use provocative questions and personal stories
- Hint at the problem without revealing the solution
- Measure interest before writing a single line of code

In this 6-minute video, I walk you through:
âœ… The strategic frameworks I used (Golden Circle, First Principles, Design Thinking)
âœ… The exact social prompts I created for each platform
âœ… Why I'm validating in public as a teaching tool
âœ… How to protect your "secret sauce" while testing demand
âœ… The success metrics I'm tracking

**This is the exact methodology we teach in AI Money Machine** â€” my 4-week program where you build and launch your first AI-powered digital product. Not just theory. Hands-on, live guidance from idea to income.

We kick off November 1st, and I'm taking my own students through this exact validation process before they build anything.

**Here's what I want to know from you:**

1. What's the worst financial advice you received during a layoff? (Validating the problem)
2. Have you ever spent months building something only to realize there was no demand? (Teaching moment)
3. What AI product idea are YOU sitting on that needs validation? (Engagement + potential students)

Drop your answers below. And if you want to learn the full methodology â€” from validation to launch â€” check out AI Money Machine. Link in comments.

## Strategy Notes

**Why This Works:**

1. **Lead Gen Focus**
   - Opens with teaching authority ("I just taught a 60-minute crash course")
   - Positions the finance app as a CASE STUDY, not the main product
   - Clear CTA to the course ("AI Money Machine")
   - Creates FOMO (starts November 1st)
   - Link in first comment drives traffic

2. **Teaching Proof**
   - Explicitly states "as a teaching moment for my students"
   - Shows you practice what you preach
   - Walks through the methodology in the video
   - Invites others to learn the process

3. **Video Companion**
   - 6 minutes is perfect (LinkedIn max is 10)
   - Video can show the frameworks, social prompts, validation strategy
   - Feels like a mini-masterclass (high value)

**Engagement Triggers:**

- Teaching authority (establishes expertise)
- Personal vulnerability (building in public)
- Specific methodology (creates curiosity)
- Multiple engagement questions (drives comments)
- Promise of insider knowledge (course enrollment)

**LinkedIn Algorithm Optimization:**

- 1,600+ characters (optimal length)
- Multiple questions (drives comments)
- Video content (prioritized by algorithm)
- First comment with link (keeps post clean)
- Professional hashtags
- Clear value proposition

**Secret Sauce Protection:**

- Mentions the finance app problem but not the solution
- Focuses on the PROCESS of validation, not the product features
- Protects competitive advantage while demonstrating expertise

**Expected Response Types:**

1. Layoff financial stories (validates the problem)
2. "I built something nobody wanted" stories (builds rapport)
3. AI product ideas seeking validation (potential students)
4. Course enrollment inquiries
5. Methodology questions

**Conversion Path:**

1. Video watch â†’ Value demonstration
2. Comments â†’ Engagement and authority building
3. Link click â†’ Course sales page
4. Enrollment â†’ $1,497-$1,997 revenue

## Alternative Opening (If You Want Stronger Hook)

**I just spent 60 minutes teaching founders how to validate AI products before wasting months building them.**

Then I realized: I should do this live. Right now. In public.

So here's my validation experiment in real-time â€” under $100, 2 hours, zero code written.

Watch me practice what I preach â†“
